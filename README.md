ABSTRACT : Customer reviews provide insights to improve a products, services and staff interactions. Especially, In most of the fast food chains such as Mc Donalds, Subway, KFC, Chipotle etc., people donâ€™t have any particular customer review option, They buy their food and leave. One of the main reasons is time constraint, time is limited for the customer and also for the staff who works in the store. This application helps to get feedback of the product less than 10 seconds. All the customer has to do is entering his receipt number and giving his feedback in the form of his facial expressions, If the customer further wants to give more feedback he can opt for audio feedback. This feedback is stored in cloud and  The feedback collected will be shown in a graphical representation for the business purposes.
